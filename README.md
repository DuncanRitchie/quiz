# Duncan Ritchieâ€™s quiz

A challenge set for me (and my classmates) at the Code Nation bootcamp.

## Brief for w/c 27 August 2019

Hi all, it's project week this week so I'm going to set you off on yours. Remember to continue practicing on edabit too which you'll need to work around your project work.

Your projects are websites/web apps that you'll need to use HTML, CSS and JS to solve. Make them look as nice as possible.

You can ask each other questions but these are definitely individual projects not team projects.

DEADLINE 2pm FRIDAY 30TH AUGUST

### 1. A count down timer.

The user should be able to:

* Set the amount of time they want the timer to run for.
* visually see the time going down.
* see a message on the screen when the timer finishes
* hear a sound when the timer finishes
* reset the timer once the timer has finished if they wish.

### 2. A quiz app

The user should be able to:

* answer questions on the screen which are timed
* see a total score as they go along.
* see a progress bar which shows them how far through the quiz they are.

You will need to implement as scoring system. How many points for a correctly answered question? They should also get more points, the quicker they answer.

YOU can choose the category for your questions, and how many questions are to be answered.
