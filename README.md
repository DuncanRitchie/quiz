<h1>Brief for w/c 27 August 2019</h1>
<p>Hi all, it's project week this week so I'm going to set you off on yours. Remember to continue practicing on edabit too which you'll need to work around your project work.</p>
<p>Your projects are websites/web apps that you'll need to use HTML, CSS and JS to solve. Make them look as nice as possible.</p>
<p>You can ask each other questions but these are definitely individual projects not team projects.</p>
<p>DEADLINE 2pm FRIDAY 30TH AUGUST</p>
<h2>1. A count down timer.</h2>
<p>The user should be able to:<br/>
- Set the amount of time they want the timer to run for.<br/>
- visually see the time going down.<br/>
- see a message on the screen when the timer finishes<br/>
- hear a sound when the timer finishes<br/>
- reset the timer once the timer has finished if they wish.</p>
<h2>2. A quiz app</h2>
<p>The user should be able to:<br/>
- answer questions on the screen which are timed<br/>
